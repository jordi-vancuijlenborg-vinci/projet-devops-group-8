## What is a Berlin Clock?

The **Berlin Clock** (also known as the **Mengenlehreuhr** in German) is a unique clock that represents time using a series of illuminated, colored lights. Invented in 1975 by Dieter Binninger, the Berlin Clock displays the time in a different format than traditional clocks, dividing hours and minutes across four main rows of lights. This clock has become a symbol of Berlin, offering an abstract, binary approach to reading time.

## Project Overview

This project is a digital representation of the Berlin Clock, built as a collaborative effort by Group 8. It aims to simulate the time display of the Berlin Clock using modern web development tools. The clock will visually demonstrate how the binary nature of the Berlin Clock can represent time with colors and patterns, providing an interactive and educational experience.
